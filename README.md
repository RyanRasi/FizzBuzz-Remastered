# FizzBuzz-Remastered
The classic game of from the integers 0 to 100, the integers are printed, if it's a multiple of 3 'fizz' is printed, if 5 then 'buzz' is printed. If it's both then 'fizzbuzz' is printed. <br><br>This is different as the user has a menu to specify the multiples for fizz and buzz and this is checked for validation. Also menu loops are in place as well as an application terminated screen. 
<br><br>
Most of the code is also commented for easy readability as well as the inclusion of seperate classes for the menu and the actual game. 
<br><br>
Most of the determination for the number checking is done via if statements which change or add to a string if the conditions are active such as a multiple of 3, multiple of 5 or not a multiple of 3 or 5 in which case one or more conditions will be active at any one time. The output string is then printed and the menu screen is displayed where the user can choose to go again with the same paramters for the multiples or change them into something else.
